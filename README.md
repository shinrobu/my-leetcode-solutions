These are the ways I've done some of the leetcode problems! I've started working on them while I still have a lot to learn, so some of these may not be the most optimal. If I come up with better solutions, they'll be added in the form of a comment at the bottom of the original, along with the new runtime and memory usage. 

Problems will be labeled in this format: `problem-#.cs`
